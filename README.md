# ACRIMA-Glaucoma-Clinical-Classification

This project focuses on the clinical classification of glaucoma by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques applied to retinal images and associated clinical data from the ACRIMA dataset. The objective is to develop accurate, reliable models that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis of glaucoma, improving patient outcomes.

Key components include image preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and validation using various algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks. The project aims to combine clinical and imaging data to enhance classification performance and provide interpretable results to support clinical decision-making.

The repository contains scripts, notebooks, and documentation necessary to reproduce the data processing pipeline, model development, and evaluation metrics.
